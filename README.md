# team_percentiles
 This is a bit of a dual purpose repo. (1) I am going to use this repo to become more familiar with extracting NFL data with "nflfastR." (2) My overall goal is to identify how all NFL seasons (by team) in the modern era stack up to one another. I want to basically create a distribution of all NFL seasons (by team) to identify just how good of a seson a team is having.
